bio: |
  If you were to make a top-ten list of the best Improvisors in Portland,
  coincidentally (or not so coincidentally) most of the names on that list are J Names.
  This group is made up of Michael Jordan’s from every comedy theater in Portland.
  J Names came out as a record setter on the competitive show Friday Night Fights and
  has never slowed:Out-of-Bounds Comedy Festival, Vancouver International Improv Festival,
  San Diego Improv Festival, Seattle Festival of Improvised Theater, etc…
