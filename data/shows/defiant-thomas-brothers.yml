location: "Chicago, IL"
bio: |
  The Defiant Thomas Brothers are Seth Thomas and Paul Thomas. Known for their
  commanding stage presence, commitment to character and timing, and ability to mine laughs all
  along the sensitivity spectrum, the Defiant Thomas Brothers roamed the Chicago comedy
  stages in the pre-YouTube era when political correctness was only a child. Just over two years
  after they began running their sketch show once a week in a black box theater in Chicago's
  Uptown, they were invited to HBO’s prestigious U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, where they won the
  award for best sketch group alongside best alternative act Flight of the Conchords. A year later,
  they were gone. In 2015, they came back. After a much-anticipated return in Chicago, they
  completed an extended run at Second City’s Donny’s Skybox and Second City Blackout
  Cabaret, and have been performing across the country ever since.
