title: "Archibald & Hill & Friends"
bio: |
  Since starting in Level 1 class together at the iO Chicago, Archibald & Hill
  have been "improv brothers".  Playing as a part of the powerhouse team
  "People of Earth" and in many different shows since, they embraced a style
  that uses the height of their intelligence and the depth of their silly (often in the
  same scene).  Together as a duo, the two perform a theatrical and energetic
  style of improv that draws on a wide variety of characters, tones and scenarios.

  And maybe there will be friends?
