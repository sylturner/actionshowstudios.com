location: "Atlanta, GA"
bio: |
  The Tipsy Zone is a fully improvised long form show based on the cult classic TV show the Twilight Zone.
  All our performers perform in black and white period clothing in the 50's and 60's style. To make the
  show even more difficult, a small liquor bar sets just off center stage. At any time during the show,
  any actor can offer another actor a drink and they must accept AND finish that drink before they're
  allowed to leave the stage. Come and join us as we leave this dimension behind and slowly enter...
  _The Tipsy Zone_!
