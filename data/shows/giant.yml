title: "Giant"
location: "Atlanta, GA"
bio: |
  _Giant_, is an improv duo consisting of two small humans, Tom and Karen.
  What they lack in stature, they make up for in commitment and character work on stage.
  In this show you get to watch the relationship between two beautifully created in depth
  characters exploring their emotions in one setting.

  There will be moments of awkward silent tension, laughter, anger, and a hysterically
  passionate interpretive dance. Hold on to that Six Flags coupon folks, because this
  roller coaster of emotions will be the best ride all year.

  Tom and Karen are both ensemble members at Dad's Garage Theater and have been each
  performing improv for 10+ years. They have both been teaching, learning, and performing
  locally and internationally from Edmonton's Improvaganza to Georgia Tech's Black Box Festival.
