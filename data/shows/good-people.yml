title: "Good People"
location: "Chicago, IL"
bio: |
  We met on our first improv team we were ever on in Chicago, it was called Shrimp Sale.
  After tequila shots on True's birthday we were instant best friends. We've navigated
  through the ups and downs of comedy in Chicago but have remained together the entire time.
  We're just a couple of good people in this world doing our best.
