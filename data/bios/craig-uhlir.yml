bio: |
  Craig Uhlir was born and raised in Chicago, in the USA. After completing his training
  at Chicago’s big three improvisational schools: Second City, improvOlympics, and the
  Annoyance back in the 90's, Craig began playing with Harold teams *Deep Schwa* and
  Vahalla. He also played at ComedySportz Chicago for 4 years doing short form improv.
  He toured with the Second City National Touring Company going around the world and
  then performed in Second City Las Vegas at the Flamingo hotel for 3 years. These days
  Craig teaches at iO (formerly improvOlympics) and The Second City. He still performs
  every Sunday night in *Deep Schwa* at iO, Chicago’s longest running Harold team. Craig
  has been playing for over 20 years and teaching since the turn of the century. I would
  say Craig’s specialty is group work and teaching others how to put the *fun* in funny.
